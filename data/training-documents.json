For example: \"So, should we schedule the implementation for next week or the week after?\"\n\n## The Summary Close\n\nSummarize all the benefits and value points that the prospect has responded positively to, then ask for the business. For example: \"We've discussed how our solution addresses your three main concerns: efficiency, cost, and ease of use. Are you ready to move forward?\"\n\n## The Urgency Close\n\nCreate a sense of urgency by highlighting limited-time offers or potential consequences of delay. For example: \"This pricing is only available until the end of the month, and I'd hate for you to miss out on these savings.\"\n\n## The Question Close\n\nAsk questions that lead the prospect to the logical conclusion that they should buy. For example: \"If we could solve your inventory management problems while staying within your budget, would you be ready to proceed?\"\n\n## Best Practices for Closing\n\n1. **Trial closes** - Test readiness throughout the conversation\n2. **Handle objections** - Address concerns before attempting to close\n3. **Be silent** - After asking for the sale, wait for the customer to respond\n4. **Follow up** - If not successful, schedule a specific time to reconnect",
